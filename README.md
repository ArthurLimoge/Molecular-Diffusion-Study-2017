# Molecular Diffusion 2017 Project
Tutored Personal Work (French: TPE - Travaux Personnels Encadrés)

This is a highschool project we have, Arthur LIMOGE and Justine CHOL have had the opportunity to work on in the beginning of the year 2017.

We had decided to study molecular diffusion in physics and chemistry, which had us work first on the theoretical part:
both on the probabilistic approach, with normal distribution, and on the thermodynamical approach, with Fick and Fourier's laws,
the divergence theorem, etc...

On the experimental part, we then worked on numerous experiments in order to confirm our theoretical results. All of them are described
and explained in the report enclosed herewith.

This project was accomplished thanks to the help of researchers and teachers who accepted to help us and provide us with various papers:

Tony Lelièvre, researcher in applied mathematics at CERMICS

François Vanderbrouck, physics teacher in the Louis-Le-Grand Classe Preparatoires
