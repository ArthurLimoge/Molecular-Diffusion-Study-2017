# TPE
Tutored Personal Work - 2017 project

This TPE a highschool project I have had the opportunity to work on with Justine CHOL, a student in chemistry.

We had decided to study molecular diffusion in physics and chemistry, which had us work first on the theoretical part:
both on the probabilistic approach, with normal distribution, and on the thermodynamical approach, with Fick and Fourier's laws,
the divergence theorem, etc...

On the experimental part, we then worked on numerous experiments in order to confirm our theoretical results. All of them are described
and explained in the report enclosed herewith.

This project was accomplished thanks to the help of researchers and teachers who accepted to help us and provide us with various papers:
Tony Lelièvre, researcher in applied mathematics at CERMICS
François Vanderbrouck, physics teacher in the Louis-Le-Grand Classe Preparatoires
