Molecular Diffusion Study (2017) - Language: French
=====

This is a highschool research project we worked one with Justine Chol in 2017.
It took place over the span of three months, and we decided to organize our research in three big axes:

Probabilistic approach
----- 

This first part consists in mathematically working out the diffusion equation in one-dimension (following random walk theory).
We then went on to modelize a random walk in Python, to check out the mathematical results.

Macroscopic consistency
----- 

This second part rather focuses on experimentally checking the results obtained in part 1, after a quick description of Brownian movement.

Getting a better understanding of the phenomenon
-----

This last part was a way for us to look back at the results we had obtained. We worked on a general derivation of the diffusion equation in three dimensions, following Fick's law; then applied a similar pattern to heat equations.

We then decided to end the document by presenting a few limits of this model - mostly when it comes to quantum physics, by presenting examples of simulations in carbon nanotubes.
